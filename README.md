<b> Lab | <b>Microcontroller 8051
<b> Experiment|     <b> 1. (RIC 651) Write a program to generate 10 KHz square wave using 8051.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

Students should be able to write the assembly language code of 8051 Microcontroller and should be able to check it's results after execution. Following are the objectives:
1. To be able to develop the program in assembly language of 8051 for specific task or application Microcontroller
2. To be able to execute the program
3. To be able to execute the program in single instruction execution
4. To be able to point out the errors in Instruction
5. To check the output of the execution

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

To generate the square wave with 8051 Microcontroller, following steps are followed
1. Select any port pin where square is to be generated. Here port 1.0 pin is selected
2. Depending upon crystal frequency , number of count to be used in delay program Instructions are calculated. Here crystal frequency is assumed 12 MHz. So each count is of 1 microsecond
3. 10 khz square wave means ontime plus off time is 100 microseconds. That is ontime 50 microseconds and offtime 50 microsecond
4. But for simulation square wave is observed as LED ON OFF, so 10 khz will not work
5. For ontime period port 1.0 pin shoud be high
6. For offtime period port 1.0 pin should be low
7. This sequence should be continued

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

This experiment is useful for the students as well as the faculties who are involved in teaching-learning process of the course in Microcontroller-8051.
